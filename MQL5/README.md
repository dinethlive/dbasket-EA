# D-Basket EA - Correlation Hedging Expert Advisor

A production-level MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor implementing a three-pair correlation hedging strategy for AUDCAD, NZDCAD, and AUDNZD.

## Overview

This EA exploits the mathematical relationship between three currency pairs:

```
AUDNZD â‰ˆ AUDCAD / NZDCAD
```

When the synthetic ratio (AUDCAD/NZDCAD) diverges from the actual AUDNZD price, the EA enters a hedged three-leg basket expecting mean reversion.

## Strategy Summary

- **Long Basket** (when AUDNZD appears underpriced):
  - Long AUDNZD
  - Short AUDCAD
  - Long NZDCAD

- **Short Basket** (when AUDNZD appears overpriced):
  - Short AUDNZD
  - Long AUDCAD
  - Short NZDCAD

## Features

- **Multi-Symbol Management**: Single EA instance manages all three symbols internally
- **Z-Score Based Signals**: Statistical divergence detection using rolling correlation and z-score
- **Multi-Stage Signal Filtering**: 8 validation stages including spread, correlation, volatility, and time filters
- **Coordinated Basket Execution**: All 3 legs executed atomically with rollback on failure
- **Circuit Breaker System**: Automatic trading halt on drawdown, daily loss, or margin warnings
- **State Recovery**: Recovers basket state after EA restart
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics with chart display

## Requirements

> 
> This EA requires a broker account with hedging enabled. Netting accounts will NOT work.

| Margin Level | 500% | Below 200% |
| Consecutive Losses | - | 6 or more |

### Emergency Exit

- Margin level drops below 150%
- System detects critical error

## Backtesting

5. Select "Every tick based on real ticks" for accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### "Hedging account required" error
Your broker account is in netting mode. Contact your broker to switch to a hedging account.

### EA not opening trades

2. Current Z-score meets entry threshold
3. Spreads within limits
4. Within trading hours
5. Correlation above minimum

### Partial basket
If a basket is only partially filled, the EA will:
1. Attempt to complete the basket
2. If unable, close the opened legs
3. Log the issue for review
